          CSS-Tricks* is created, written by, and maintained by Chris Coyier and
          a team of swell people. The tech stack for this site is fairly boring.
          That's a good thing! I've used WordPress since day one all the way up
          to v17, a decision I'm very happy with. I also leverage Jetpack for
          extra functionality and Local for local development.
